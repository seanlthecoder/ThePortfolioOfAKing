## Developer Portfolio

The ultimate goal with this project is to provide a website that provides information about who I am and to highlight my ongoing work as a growing developer.

Another goal is to make sure code follows semantic concepts so that the code is realtively clean.



## User Story

AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## basic info
In attempting to construct a unique portfolio website that can ultimately be used as a resume to highlight my ongoing work as a growing developer, I believe I was able to established a satisfying foundation or baseline for a site that I can use as an authentic way to highlight my working going forward.
